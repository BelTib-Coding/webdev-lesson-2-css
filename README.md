# Build a web page, Lesson 2 â€“ Design and CSS

## Overview

Today's lesson is about
[Cascading Style Sheets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
more commonly known as CSS. We are going to use CSS to improve the _look
and feel_ of our stories.

### What is CSS?

CSS is a language that can be used to describe how HTML is supposed to look.
The important distinction here is that HTML structures the content,
while CSS controls how it looks.

Let's look at the difference. Here's the CSS from @jonmagic's story last week:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial;
  background-color: #eee;
  color: green;
}

img {
  border: 2px solid green;
  padding: 2px;
}
```

And the HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A day at the dog park</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A day at the dog park</h1>
    <p>Today I took the dogs to the park and <strong>we had a great time!</strong></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2f473l1d233S0S1k3J3d/dogs-playing.jpg">
    <p>After the dogs played with their friends <em>we took a walk around the track together.</em></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0o0T0V0g261C1R0I022z/walking-the-track.jpg">
    <p>While we were at the dog park we saw many kinds of dogs, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poodles</li>
      <li>Great Danes</li>
      <li>Black Labs</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

When we combine them using CodePen, we get a page that looks like this:

We can get an idea of what's happening by looking at each line of the CSS.

* For any ```body``` tags
    1. Use ```Arial``` as the font
    2. Set the background color to ```#eee``` (A ***hex color***)
    3. Set the foreground color to ```green```
* For any ```img``` tags
    1. Give it a ```2px``` wide, ```solid``` border and color it ```green```
    2. Give it ```2px``` of ***padding***

> ***hex color*** - A way to describe colors using
> [hex code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal). This is used a lot in
> CSS because it allows more specific color selection than just ```blue``` or
> ```green```. A hex color mixes red, green, and blue components. In CSS code,
> a hex color looks kind of like ```#RRGGBB``` or ```#RGB```. Using CodePen,
> we can press Alt to bring up a color picker that can help us find hex color
> codes.
