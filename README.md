# Build a web page, Lesson 2 â€“ Design and CSS

## Overview

Today's lesson is about
[Cascading Style Sheets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
more commonly known as CSS. We are going to use CSS to improve the _look
and feel_ of our stories.

### What is CSS?

CSS is a language that can be used to describe how HTML is supposed to look.
The important distinction here is that HTML structures the content,
while CSS controls how it looks.

Let's look at the difference. Here's the HTML from @jonmagic's story last week:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A day at the dog park</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A day at the dog park</h1>
    <p>Today I took the dogs to the park and <strong>we had a great time!</strong></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2f473l1d233S0S1k3J3d/dogs-playing.jpg">
    <p>After the dogs played with their friends <em>we took a walk around the track together.</em></p>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0o0T0V0g261C1R0I022z/walking-the-track.jpg">
    <p>While we were at the dog park we saw many kinds of dogs, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poodles</li>
      <li>Great Danes</li>
      <li>Black Labs</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the CSS:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial;
  background-color: #eee;
  color: green;
}

img {
  border: 2px solid green;
  padding: 2px;
}
```

When we combine them using CodePen, we get a page that looks like this:
